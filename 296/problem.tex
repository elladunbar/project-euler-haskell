\section{Problem Description}
Given is an integer-sided triangle $ABC$ with $BC \leq AC \leq AB$

$k$ is the angular bisector of angle $ACB$

$m$ is the tangent at $C$ to the circumscribed circle of $ABC$

$n$ is a line parallel to $m$ through $B$

The intersection of $n$ and $k$ is called $E$

\section{Problem Question}
How many triangles $ABC$ with perimeter not exceeding $100000$ exist such that $BE$ has integral length?
